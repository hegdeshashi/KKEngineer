Troubleshoot Issue With Pods
========================
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

â€“ Winston Churchill
======================
One of the junior DevOps team members was working on to deploy a stack on Kubernetes cluster. Somehow the pod is not coming up and its failing with some errors. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please look into it.



There is a pod named webserver and the container under it is named as nginx-container. It is using image nginx:latest

There is a sidecar container as well named sidecar-container which is using ubuntu:latest image.

Look into the issue and fix it, make sure pod is in running state and you are able to access the app.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
====================
Solution:
kubectl get pods -A -------> pod is not running state.. need to verify what went wrong
kubectl describe pod webserver ---> image is having issue.
kubectl edit pod webserver ---> change image from nginx :latests to nginx:latest
kubectl get pods

--< --make sure pod is running state..

verify & solve it.
