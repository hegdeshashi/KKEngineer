============
There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.



Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Also make sure every user can execute it.
===========
 ls -lart /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
    2  chmod o+rx /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
    3  ls -lart /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
    4  cat /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
    5  sh /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
