Deploy Apache Web Server on Kubernetes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Problem :
There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:



Create a namespace named as httpd-namespace-nautilus.

Create a deployment named as httpd-deployment-nautilus under newly created namespace. For the deployment use httpd image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest, and make sure replica counts are 2.

Create a service named as httpd-service-nautilus under same namespace to expose the deployment, nodePort should be 30004.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.:
Solution:


cat tmp.yaml-->
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpd-service-nautilus
  namespace: httpd-namespace-nautilus
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: httpd_app_nautilus
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30004
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-deployment-nautilus
  namespace: httpd-namespace-nautilus
  labels:
    app: httpd_app_nautilus
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd_app_nautilus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd_app_nautilus
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: httpd-container-nautilus
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
------------

kubectl create  ns httpd-namespace-nautilus
kubectl create -f tmp.yaml -n httpd-namespace-nautilus

kubectl get all -n httpd-namespace-nautilus
now verify service and deployments .
