The things always happens that you really believe in; and the belief in a thing makes it happen.

â€“ Frank Lloyd Wright
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

================

a. Create a docker network named as news on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use bridge drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet 10.10.1.0/24 and iprange 10.10.1.3/24.
