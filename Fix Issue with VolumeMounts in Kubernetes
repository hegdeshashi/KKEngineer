Fix Issue with VolumeMounts in Kubernetes
==================================
Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

Problem statement:
We deployed a Nginx and PHP-FPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine so far. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:



The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Figure out the issue and fix the same.


Once issue is fixed, copy /home/thor/index.php file from the jump host to the nginx-container under nginx document root and you should be able to access the website using Website button on top bar.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
