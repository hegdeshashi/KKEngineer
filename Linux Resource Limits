Question:
On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:



a. soft limit = 1025


b. hard_limit = 2024
============
Step by step guide:

login to stratos datacenter with sudo



vi /etc/security/limits.conf
nfsuser soft nproc 1025
nfsuser hard nproc 2024
cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^
