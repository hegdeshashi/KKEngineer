Question:
On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = 1025
b. hard_limit = 2024
============
Soluti
Step by step guide:

login to stratos datacenter with sudo
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su
cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^ -- > will not give any output... coming as blank..
now add limits as mentioned in the problem..

vi /etc/security/limits.conf
	nfsuser soft nproc 1025
	nfsuser hard nproc 2024
----> save & close
cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^
verify the output as ---> nfsuser soft nproc 1025
					nfsuser hard nproc 2024

now submit & close the task.
