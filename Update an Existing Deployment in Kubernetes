Question:
There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently, the Nautilus application development team developed a new version of the application that needs to be deployed now. As per new updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:


We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and service.

1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Change the image from nginx:1.19 to nginx:latest

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
==================
Step by step answer:
 kubectl get pods
    kubectl get deploy
    kubectl get svc
    kubectl edit svc nginx-service --->chnge port from 30008 to 32165
   kubectl get svc
---> make sure port changed...

  kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment 
----> change replicas from 1 to 5 and also image from nginx:1.19 to nginx:latest
 kubectl get deploy
    ---> verify that replicas changed from 1 to 5
kubectl get pods --->
