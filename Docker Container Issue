======================
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.

=============
Problem Statement:
There is a static website running within a container named nautilus, this container is running on App Server 1. Suddenly, we started facing some issues with the static website on App Server 1. Look into the issue to fix the same, you can find more details below:



Container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

The website should run on host port 8080 on App Server 1 i.e command curl http://localhost:8080/ should work on App Server 1.
=============
Step by step answer:

docker ps  
docker start nautilus
  docker ps
  docker logs nautilus
  docker inspect nautilus
  docker port nautilus
  curl http://localhost:8080/
  docker exec -it nautilus bash
docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health.Status}}" nautilus
curl http://localhost:8080/
