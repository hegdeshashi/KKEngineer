Linux User Without Home
==========
A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.

â€“ Nelson Mandela
===========
Problem:
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool.

Create a user named kirsty in App Server 1 without a home directory.
=============
login to stapp01

ssh tony@stapp01

  id kirsty
   cat /etc/passwd | grep kirsty
   useradd -M kirsty
   id kirsty
   cat /etc/passwd | grep kirsty
   
  ls -lart /home
make sure kirtsy not created in this home directory
now check & submit
