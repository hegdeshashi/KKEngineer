Linux User Files
=========
The things always happens that you really believe in; and the belief in a thing makes it happen.

â€“ Frank Lloyd Wright
===================
There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 3 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. Find the details below:

On App Server 3 find all files (not directories) owned by user anita inside /home/usersdata directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /official directory.
============
login to stapp03
ssh banner@stapp03

find /home/usersdata/. -type f -user anita -exec cp --parents {} /official \;

now check all data copied to /official or not..
ll /official/home/usersdata

now submit
close the task
