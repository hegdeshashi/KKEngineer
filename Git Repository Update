Git Repository Update:
An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.

â€“ Benjamin Franklin
==========
Problem:
The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repo /opt/official.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.



Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, add/commit the file and push to master branch.

thor@jump_host:
   2  ls /tmp
    3  sudo scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp
    4  ssh natasha@ststor01
root@ststor01 official
    1  pwd
    2  ls /tmp
    3  ls -lart /tmp
    4  cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/
    5  ls -lart
    6  cd official/
    7  ls -lart
    8  cp /tmp/index.html .
    9  ls -lart
   10  git add index.html 
   11  git commit -m "added index.html"
   12  git push -u origin master
