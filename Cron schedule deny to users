Question:
To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 3.

Allow crontab access to ammar user and deny the same to eric user.
