Cron schedule deny to users
=========
The only thing standing between you and outrageous success is continuous progress.

Question:
To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 3.

Allow crontab access to ammar user and deny the same to eric user.
===========
login to stapp03
ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su 
vi /etc/cron.deny
add eric  
vi /etc/cron.allow
add ammar  
systemctl restart crond.service
  systemctl status crond.service
