Linux User Expiry:


A developer named james has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for james. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named james on the App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.:
