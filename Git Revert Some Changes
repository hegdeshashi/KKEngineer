Git Revert Some Changes:
Regret for the time wasted can become a power of good in the time that remains.

â€“ Arthur Brisbane
-----------------===================
Problem:
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:



In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).

Use revert games message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

SOlution:
------------------
login to storage server with sudo :
ssh natasha@ststor01 --

 1  cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games/
    2  ls
    3  git status
    4  git log
    5  git revert HEAD
    6  git add .
    7  git commit -m "revert data"
    8  git log


verify now..
