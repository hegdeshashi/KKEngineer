Ansible Lineinfile Module:

Problem:
-------------------------------------------------------
Quest
The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.



We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:

Install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
==============
Solution:

cat playbook.yml

- name: Install httpd and setup index.html

  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03

  become: yes

  tasks:

     - name: Install httpd

       package:

         name: httpd

         state: present

     - name: Start service httpd, if not started

       service:

         name: httpd

         state: started

     - name: Add content block in index.html and set permissions

       blockinfile:

         path: /var/www/html/index.html

         create: yes

         block: |

         owner: apache

         group: apache
