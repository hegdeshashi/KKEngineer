There is data on jump host that needs to be copied on all application servers in Stratos DC. Nautilus DevOps team want to perform this task using Ansible. Perform the task as per details mentioned below:



a. On jump host create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory and add all application servers as managed nodes.

b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml to copy /usr/src/devops/index.html file to all application servers at location /opt/devops.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@  ansible_user=steve

stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n  ansible_user=banner

ansible all -a "ls -ltr /opt/devops" -i inventory

 cat playbook.yml
