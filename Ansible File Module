Ansible File Module
==================
Don't give up. Normally it is the last key on the ring which opens the door.

â€“ Paulo Coelho
=================
Problem statement:
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to test several Ansible modules on servers in Stratos DC. Recently they wanted to test the file creation on remote hosts using Ansible. Find below more details about the task:


a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and add all app servers in it.


b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /opt/code.txt on all app servers.


c. The /opt/code.txt file permission must be 0744.


d. The user/group owner of file /opt/code.txt must be tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
