Ansible Basic Playbook
======================
A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.

â€“ Nelson Mandela

Problem statement:
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only able to create the inventory, and due to other priorities that came in he has to work on other tasks. Please pick up this task from where he left off and complete it. Below are more details about the task:

The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory seems to be having some issues, please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 2 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.


Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 2.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
===================
Step by step answer:

Update --in the file -->/home/thor/ansible/inventory
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'

cat /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml --->
- name: Create file in appserver

  hosts: stapp02

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Create the file

      file:

        path: /tmp/file.txt


        state: touch
---------
cd ansible/
 ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory --> no file.txt created
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
 ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory ---> file.txt created succesfully.
-----
now submit the task & close it.
