Linux Remote Copy
===============
Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

– Marva Collins
===========
 One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. That data must be copied to one of the app servers. Because developers do not have access to app servers, they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 at location /home/nfsshare.
===========
scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@stapp01:/home/nfsshare/
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su
ls -lart /home/nfsshare

now confirm that file = nautilus.txt.gpg exists in this dir.
now submit
& close the task.
