Linux Access Control List
========
The Nautilus security team performed an audit on all servers present in Stratos DC. During the audit some critical data/files were identified which were having the wrong permissions as per security standards. Once the report was shared with the production support team, they started fixing the issues one by one. It has been identified that one of the files named /etc/hostname on Nautilus App 3 server has wrong permissions, so that needs to be fixed and the correct ACLs needs to be set.



1. The user owner and group owner of the file should be root user.

2. Others must have read only permissions on the file.

3. User javed must not have any permission on the file.

4. User garrett should have read only permission on the file.
==============
login to stapp03
ssh banner@stapp03
login as sudo
sudo su -
    getfacl /etc/hostname
    id javed
    id garrett
    setfacl -m u:javed:-,garrett:r /etc/hostname
    getfacl /etc/hostname

now makesure all user have correct ACL permission set
------------
criteria:
The -m (--modify) and -M (--modify-file) options modify the ACL of a file or directory. ACL entries for this operation must include permissions.

The -x (--remove) and -X (--remove-file) options remove ACL entries. It is not an error to remove an entry which does not exist. Only ACL entries without the perms field are accepted as parameters, unless the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is defined.

The perms field is a combination of characters that indicate the permissions: read ("r"), write ("w"), execute ("x"), or "execute only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user" (capital "X"). Alternatively, the perms field is an octal digit ("0"-"7").
